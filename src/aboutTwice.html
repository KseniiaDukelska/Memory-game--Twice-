            TWICE (Hangul: 트와이스) is a South Korea-based girl group formed by JYP Entertainment through the 2015 reality show Sixteen. 
        The group is composed of nine members: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung and Tzuyu. 
        The name of the group "TWICE" was named by Park Jin Young. The members also made an alias name called NaJeongMoSaJiMiDaChaeTzu,
         for everyone knows the members names in TWICE, and also for work reasons to not forget each member.
