            TWICE (Hangul: 트와이스) is a South Korea-based girl group formed by JYP Entertainment through the 2015 reality show Sixteen. 
        The group is composed of nine members: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung and Tzuyu. 
        The name of the group "TWICE" was named by Park Jin Young. The members also made an alias name called NaJeongMoSaJiMiDaChaeTzu,
         for everyone knows the members names in TWICE, and also for work reasons to not forget each member.

    The group debuted on October 20, 2015, with the mini-album The Story Begins. Their official lightstick is called "Candy Bong".
     The official Twice logo that connects T and W was designed by member Chaeyoung and is put in all of TWICE's official activities. 
     On the official SNS accounts and YouTube channel, the logo is also updated to match the concept color on every comeback and used as a profile picture.
